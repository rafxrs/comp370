Give short answers to the following questions.
1.	Give four reasons why a cloud machine is better than a laptop for data science work at scale.
    - cloud machine can stay up "forever" -> laptops come with uptime problems
    - cloud machines usually have better storage and compute power than laptops
    - cloud machines have better security infrastructure than laptops
    - cloud machines can be accessed from anywhere
2.	List out the stages in the data science process and define each (in 1 sentence)
    - Question Definition: coming up with a realistic question that proper data analysis can answer
    - Data Collection: gathering meaningful data related to our question
    - Data Annotation: The data we collected likely isn't perfect so we have to understand and modify it in order to make it more suitable for our analysis
    - Data Analysis: analyze the annotated dataset(s) based on the question we asked
    - Result Interpretation: now that we have results we have to interpret them correctly
    - Communication: we need to be able to communicate the results of our analysis in meaningful and concise ways. If we can't do this then we are not doing justice to the four previous steps.
3.	What is the difference between data analytics and data science?
    - data analytics focuses on gaining insights on relativerly clean, existing data using statistical methods, whereas data science tends to use new data, or new methods, or ask new questions.
4.	Give an example of how a loop can occur in the data science process.
    - we can get to a point in our process -- say result interpretation, where we notice that although our analysis is correct, our approach was wrong in how we collected or annotated our data. so we have to go back to these setps, or maybe even question definition, to try again. Loops can occur this way and happen more than once. We may only get a satisfying answer to our question after repeating this process 3 times.
