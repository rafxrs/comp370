The Data Science Process

*In class, we saw the data science process. Take the first 4 phases of the data science process and explain how the different activities you performed in homework mapped into the phases – which activities were part of which phase?*

1. Question Definition
We asked ourselves how many twitter users during the election campaign of Trump mentionned him by name, and refined our question to tweets that are not questions.
2. Data Collection
We accessed and downloaded a csv file full of relevant tweets.
3. Data Annotation
After inspecting the data, we created a new label trump mention and then made a new, more refined dataset for us to carry our work out.
4. Data Analysis
We calculated how many tweets mention or not Trump based on our newly added annotation.
5. Result Interpretation
6. Communication
