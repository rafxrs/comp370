# Objective 1: Formalize the question in a way that you can actually answer. 

When you do this, follow the example given in class (online political violence) in which the question was iteratively refined. 
For each question, show at least four versions of the question.

Version 1: the question as posed by the stakeholder. 
Version 2: one refinement of the question that is more measurable and maps better onto the available data. 
Version 3: a second refinement that maps even better onto the available data. 
Version 4: the final version of the question that is directly quantifiable and maps onto the available data.
