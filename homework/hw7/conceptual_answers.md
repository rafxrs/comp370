1. What is the difference between found and designed data?
   Found data is usually a lot messier and raw / not necessarily suited as-is for our specific needs because it wasn't intended for it. Designed data on the other hand is specifically designed for our project and thus much "nicer" to use
2. What are the two primary challenges that necessitate sampling when collecting data?
   - Time and cost constraints — collecting data from an entire population is often too expensive and time-consuming. Sampling allows gathering data more efficiently while keeping costs and effort manageable.
   - Practicality and accessibility. It’s often impractical or impossible to collect data from every individual in the population due to factors like geographic spread, limited access, or population size. Sampling provides a feasible way to obtain representative data when full collection isn’t possible.
3. Why are website owners more likely to be upset about collecting data using scrapers than using APIs?
   - Lack of control and consent: APIs are controlled entry points but scrapign is not controllable by the owners.
   - IP: when scraping their website, owners may be at a loss of IP.
   - Server load and perfomance: scraping can add load onto the owners servers.
