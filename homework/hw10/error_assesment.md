# ERROR ASSESSMENT

Across both datasets, every post had at least a majority agreement (2 out of 3 annotators). There were no cases where all three annotators disagreed. However, full agreement (3 out of 3) was not always achieved. The disagreements mainly happened in predictable boundary areas where categories overlap.

1. Career vs Programs
Posts about grad school applications, co-op, or professional requirements were sometimes labeled as Career and sometimes as Programs. Annotators differed on whether they saw the post as academic planning or professional development.

2. Academics vs Well-being
Posts mentioning stress (e.g., exam stress, failing a class) were sometimes labeled as Academics and sometimes as Well-being, depending on whether the annotator focused on the emotional content or the academic context.

3. Campus Life vs Administrative
Posts involving campus events, disruptions, or rules (exam conflict rules, protests, room issues) could fit in either category. Some annotators emphasized the policy aspect, while others emphasized the student experience aspect.

4. Campus Life vs Lost & Found
A few posts involving items or personal listings (e.g., cat for adoption) were interpreted differently depending on whether the annotator viewed them as classifieds or general campus life.

5. Low-context titles
Some short titles (e.g., “Public relations interest”, “Recommendations for these courses”) lacked enough detail, leading to reasonable but different interpretations.

Overall, disagreements occurred because the categories naturally overlap and Reddit titles often give minimal context. Despite this, annotators consistently converged to at least a majority decision, showing that the taxonomy was usable and reasonably clear.
